goofimports
===========

Based on https://github.com/eugeii/goimports, this is another fork of goimports (golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports)
that allows to skip the walk through all directories included in `$(GOPATH)/.goignore`. It basically makes goimports
fast again.

### Install.

```sh
go get github.com/maraino/goofimports
```
